"
" Important things for beginners:
" * Start out small... Don't jam your vimrc full of things you're not ready to
"   immediately use.
" * Read other people's vimrc's.
" * Use a plugin manager for christ's sake! (I highly recommend vundle)
" * Spend time configuring your editor... It's important. Its the tool you
"   spend 8 hours a day crafting your reputation.
" * remap stupid things to new keys that make you more efficient.
" * Don't listen to the haters that complain about using non-default
"   key-bindings. Their argument is weak. I spend most of my time in the editor
"   on my computer, not others, so I don't care if customizing vim means I'll
"   have a harder time using remote vim.
"
" Below I've left some suggestions of good default settings to have in a bare
" minimal vimrc. You only what you want to use, and nothing more. I've heavily
" commented each, and these are what I consider bare necessities, my workflow
" absolutely depends on these things.
"
" If you have any questions, email me at pthrash@me.com
 
" Setup Vundle:
" For this to work, you must install the vundle plugin manually.
" https://github.com/gmarik/vundle
" To install vundle, copy all the files from the repo into your respective
" folders within ~/.vim

" Vundle let's you specify a plugin in a number of formats, but my favorite
" allows you to grab plugins straight off of github, just specify the bundle
" in the following format:
" Bundle 'githubUsername/repoName'
 
" Let vundle manage itself:
Plugin 'gmarik/vundle'

Plugin 'flazz/vim-colorschemes'
 
" Fuzzy finder -- absolutely must have.
Plugin 'kien/ctrlp.vim'
 
" Support for easily toggling comments.
Plugin 'tpope/vim-commentary'
 
" In addtion to the above plugins, you'll likely need some for individual
" non-standard syntaxes that aren't pre-bundled with vim. Here are some I use,
" these are required for me, but depending on what code you write, obviously
" this may differ for you.
 
" Proper JSON filetype detection, and support.
Plugin 'leshill/vim-json'
 
" vim already has syntax support for javascript, but the indent support is
" horrid. This fixes that.
Plugin 'pangloss/vim-javascript'
 
" vim indents HTML very poorly on it's own. This fixes a lot of that.
Plugin 'indenthtml.vim'
 
" I write markdown a lot. This is a good syntax.
Plugin 'tpope/vim-markdown'
 
" LessCSS -- I use this every day.
Plugin 'groenewege/vim-less'
 
" Coffee-script syntax.
Plugin 'kchmck/vim-coffee-script'

Plugin 'fatih/vim-go'
 
Plugin 'scrooloose/nerdtree'

Plugin 'majutsushi/tagbar'

Plugin 'severin-lemaignan/vim-minimap'

Plugin 'shougo/neocomplete.vim'

Plugin 'SirVer/ultisnips'

Plugin 'Yggdroot/indentLine'

Plugin 'Raimondi/delimitMate'

Plugin 'ervandew/supertab'
